# POPMOVIES - Movie Website Project

This project is made with ReactJS. The data is fetched from TMDB(TheMovie DataBase) and you can search any movies from large collection and add them to your personal list. To store the data about the user's personal list, this project uses fake JSON-server and stores the data in db.json.
The main focus of the project was to practice React and data fetching from API, but also to create beautiful and aesthetic website layout with alot of styling and animations.
